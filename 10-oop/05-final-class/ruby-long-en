<p>Ruby doesn't include any direct equivalent class of
sealing/finalization clauses. However, this behavior can be emulated
with the following method:</p>

<pre>class Foo
  def self.inherited(subclass)
    raise "Class #{subclass} cannot be derived from class #{self}"
  end
end
</pre>

<p>It works by defining a method that would be ran on any attempt to
inherit anything from a given class and would raise an exception.</p>
