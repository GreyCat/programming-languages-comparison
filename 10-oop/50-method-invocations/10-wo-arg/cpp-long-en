<p>Invocation using <b>.</b> operator is used when <b>obj</b> is a
value object (i.e. its type specification is like <b>Object
obj</b>).</p>

<p>Invocation using <b>-&gt;</b> operator is used when <b>obj</b> is a
reference to an object (i.e. its type specification is like <b>Object*
obj</b>). Using <b>-&gt;</b> is a syntactic sugar that is exactly
equal to dereferencing a reference and calling method using <b>.</b>
syntax:

<pre>
(*<b>obj</b>).<b>meth</b>();
</pre>
