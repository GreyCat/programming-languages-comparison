<p>Multi-line comments are usually marked with start and end symbols and
can easily span multiple lines. In modern world, they are usually used
to quickly comment out big section of code without any help from text
editors to include relevant single-line comments on every line:</p>

<pre>statement 1
statement 2
/*
statement 3
statement 4         // even single-line comments can be commented out
statement 5
...
*/
statement 6
...</pre>

<p>Note that most languages don't allow nested multi-line comments, i.e.
something like that:</p>

<pre>/*
statement 1    /* comment */
statement 2
<b>*/</b></pre>

<p>will break, as parser will stop multi-line comment on first
<code>*/</code> encountered, thus parsing "statement 2" as normal, not
commented-out code and ultimately reporting an error finding a lone
<code>*/</code> sign (as shown in bold).</p>
