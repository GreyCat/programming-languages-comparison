<p>One-line comments are useful to quickly mark whole line or part of
the line as a comment. Typical usage scenarios include:</p>

<pre># Comment prepending a section of program
statement 1
statement 2
...</pre>

<pre>
statement 1                 # comment related to statement 1
statement 2
statement 3                 # comment related to statement 3
...
</pre>

<p>The main drawback of this comment style is that it's hard to use to
comment out a big section of code (one has to prepend comment symbol to
every line), although modern text editors and IDEs mostly alleviate this
issue.</p>
