<p>C does not have direct string equality operator.</p>

<p><code>strcmp</code> function is a standard way to compare classic
null-terminated C strings. If it returns 0, it means that strings are
equal.</p>

<p><code>wcscmp</code> function is the same for wide strings (composed of
<code>wchar_t</code> characters).</p>
