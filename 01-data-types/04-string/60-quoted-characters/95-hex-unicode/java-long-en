<p>This kind of notation in sources is converted to real Unicode
characters by preprocessor. The compiler (i.e. language parser itself)
doesn't know anything about <code>\u</code> notation and just treats
these characters as if they were entered as proper Unicode characters
in source files. This isn't usually an issue, but it makes impossible
to escape control characters (for example, newline or quotes) this
way.</p>
