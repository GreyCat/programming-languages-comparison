<p>Technically, C# specifications do not impose any hard limit on string
length.</p>

<p>However, in practice, there are several limits that apply:</p>

<ul>

<li>As <code>Length</code> property of a string is a 32-bit integer,
absolute maximum would be 2&thinsp;147&thinsp;483&thinsp;647 characters.</li>

<li>Microsoft's CLR allows a single object to hold 2 GiB of data maximum
and its string implementation uses UTF-16 to store characters (2 bytes
per character), thus practically halving this limit.</li>

<li>Most VMs have issues with handling (and even allocating memory for)
such large objects, thus effectively limiting maximum string size to 
several 100&thinsp;000&thinsp;000s of characters.</li>

</ul>
