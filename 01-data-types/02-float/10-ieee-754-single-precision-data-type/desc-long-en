<p>Data type for floating point values, stored as per IEEE 754 standard,
"single precision" (AKA <i>binary32</i>). This floating point
representation was standardized since 1985 (in IEEE 754-1985 as
<i>single</i>) and is used in virtually all modern computers for
floating point operations.</p>

<p>Standard specifies the following components in this data type:</p>

<ul>
<li>Sign bit: 1 bit</li>
<li>Exponent width: 8 bits</li>
<li>Significand precision: 23</li>
</ul>
