<p>Normally, <code>throw</code> without argument should be used to
rethrow currently handled exception, but if it's called outside catch
context, it executes <code>std::terminate()</code>, which effectively
stops execution with abort, usually dumping core.</p>

<p>Alternatively, one can run <code>std::terminate()</code> or
<code>std::abort()</code> directly.</p>
