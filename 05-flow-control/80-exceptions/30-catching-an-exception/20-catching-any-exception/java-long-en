<p>Unconditional catch block for any exception in Java should catch
objects of <b>Exception</b> class. Note that <b>Exception</b> is not a
top-level class that can be thrown (<b>Throwable</b> is), but
normally, all other throwables (for example, subclasses of
<b>Error</b>) are truly abnormal situations (usually something
happened with execution environment) and they're not expected to be
handled gracefully by a regular application.</p>
