<p>Given that JSON is a subset of normal JavaScript expression syntax,
one can parse JSON string back into objects by just evaluating it with
<code>eval</code>. However, this practice opens a huge security risk due
to execution of arbitrary code supplied in place of expected JSON input
and, anyway, specialized JSON parser works much faster than using
<code>eval</code>.</p>

<p>Thus, since 2011 most browser vendors started to supply a
<code>JSON.parse</code> method and eventually it was accepted as a
standard in ECMAScript 5.</p>
