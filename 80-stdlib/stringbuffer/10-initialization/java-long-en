<p>
<code>StringBuffer</code> and <code>StringBuilder</code> are two Java
implementations of in-memory string buffers. They both implement
<code>Serializable</code> and <code>Appendable</code> and thus can be
used for efficient string appending and result retrieval.
</p>

<p>
The main difference between these two is that
<code>StringBuffer</code> is a thread-safe (performing additional
locks to make sure nothing will break when calling append operations
concurrently in several threads), and thus runs slightly
slower. <code>StringBuilder</code>, on the contrary, does no extra
checks and locks, and thus runs slightly faster.
